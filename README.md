YouTube Mobile UX Redesign
Problem Statement:
Mindful Watching Without Killing Engagement

🎯 My Approach
After reviewing YouTube’s existing mobile UI, I identified three key pain points:

❌ No awareness of time spent watching

❌ Autoplay hijacks attention loops

❌ No natural stopping cues within the interface

I designed a progressive, minimalistic flow using behavioral psychology principles — introducing soft nudges and interactive cues that feel native to YouTube’s visual language.

🖌️ Solution Flow
📌 Phase 1: Home Feed (0–20 mins)
Added a thin progress bar subtly blinking above the video, indicating session time.

Progressively filled with brand color cues while maintaining clean YouTube UI aesthetics.

📌 Phase 2: Video Player (20–45 mins)
After 25 minutes, the Like button transforms into a clock icon for 3 seconds.

Tapping it opens a bottom sheet prompt:

🎈 Take a Quick Break

🔕 Continue Watching

Includes an optional timer to auto-resume after 2 minutes.

📌 Phase 3: Autoplay Interstitial (After 30 mins)
Before the next video autoplays, a friendly modal appears:

Encouraging a break

Options to ‘Take a Quick Break’, ‘Keep Watching’, or ‘Extend Break’

Acts as a stopping cue between autoplay transitions while preserving control.

🎨 Design Principles
1. Seamless integration into YouTube’s current mobile UI

2. Minimal, non-intrusive, and behavior-driven cues

3. Reinforcing positive content consumption habits without harming engagement
